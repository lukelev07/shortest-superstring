This contains data you can use to test your DNA assembly program.
The file format is described in the HW9 assignment.

reads1.txt, reads6.txt are a very easy warmup you can use to test your code.
reads2.txt, reads7.txt are an easy case.
reads3.txt, reads8.txt are a slightly harder case.
reads4.txt, reads5.txt, reads9.txt, reads10.txt are standard size cases.

answer1.txt, ..., answer5.txt are the correct answer for
reads1.txt, ..., reads5.txt.

For full credit, be sure to handle all of reads1.txt-reads10.txt.

We will provide additional DNA sequences in another day, so please
check back again.

We have also provided a script to make it easy to run your program.
If your program can be executed with, say, 'python code/assemble.py',
then you can run './runall python code/assemble.py' on the Unix
command line, and it will run your program on all of the inputs,
save its output to the appropriate files (output1-10.txt), and
compare your output1-5.txt to the known-good answer1-5.txt.
